Bridging the Gap Engineering was tasked with determining the most efficient bridge design for a highway spanning Bryce Creek along Begley Road in Cabell County, West Virginia.

The bridge spans 125 feet in length with a 12 degree skew and a one percent downgrade. While utilizing two 12 foot wide traffic lanes and two 3 foot shoulders, the bridge is intended to carry an average daily traffic of 5000 \(\frac{\textrm{vehicles}}{\textrm{day}}\).

The deck will consist of a concrete slab that has a 28-day compressive strength of 4.0 ksi. The superstructure will also contain elastomeric bearing pads, diagphragms, shear stiffeners, and deck shear connectors.

The girder design will be optimized after the evaluation of multiple alternatives. Both the concrete and steel alternatives will be evaluated. The alternatives will be evaluated on the basis of capacity, cost effectiveness, shipping requirements, and manufaturing availability.

After the alternatives were evaluated, it was more cost effective to select a steel plate girder design with four girders.
